## Description
Bessie the Cow doesn't like Farmer John and wants to crash his computer. Help Bessie the Cow in this endeavor by causing an OutOfMemoryException (or similar) in online-ide.com!
The cows want to do this while Farmer John goes to the cow vet to get some medicine for his poor cows and so they can't code more than 25 lines of code and only have 26 seconds to crash it after clicking the run button.
